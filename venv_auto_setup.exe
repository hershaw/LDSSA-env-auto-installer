# Bash script for creating the environments + installing packages in each 
# requirements.txt file.

# This .exe file should be placed inside the SXX folder (e.g. S01 - Bootcamp and Binary Classification),
# where all the SLU of a given month are placed.

# To run it, go to command line (or wsl in Windows) and just write "directory/venv_auto_setup.exe"
# (or change the directory, with cd, to the SXX folder you want to look at and after that run " ./venv_auto_setup.exe"

# What the script does:
# - iterates over each folder inside (one per SLU),
# - takes the number "N" of the SLU,
# - creates and activates a virtual environment named "sluN"
# - updates "pip" package
# - installs "wheel" package (don't know why, but had to do this)
# - installs the packages from the requirements.txt in the iterated slu folder
# - deactivates newly created environment
# - iterates over the next slu folder

# Note: for Windows users (such as me) it is important to create Bash scripts in 
# text editors that encode end-of-line as LF (whereas the classic Windows notepad CRLF*)
